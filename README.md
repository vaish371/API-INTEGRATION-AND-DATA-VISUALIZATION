*MENTOR*: NEELA SANTOSH

*DESCRIPTION*: I have performed API INTEGRATION AND DATA VISUALIZATION  task using python.
               I have used some tools for this project those are:
                   1.python:The core programming language used to write the script
                   2.requests library:A Python library used to make HTTP requests to the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch the weather data.
                   3.OpenWeatherMap API:The external public API that provides the weather data.
               API integration and data visualization using python is highly applicable in a wide range of fields and projects.
               for example:
                   1.Environmental Monitoring & Smart cities:
                       *Air Quality Monitoring:Integrate with air quality APIs to visualize pollution levels in different areas.
                       *Resource Management:Monitor energy consumption,water levels,or waste management data exposed through APIs.
                   2.Business Intelligence & Analytics:
                       *Financial Analysis:Get stock prices,economic indicators from financial APIs to create custom market visualizations and tracking tools.
                   3.Health & public Health:
                       *Fetch public health data,disease spread statistics, or demographic information from government APIs and visualize trends for research or public awareness.
                   4.Educational Tools:
                       *Develop interactive tools that allow students to explore real-world data( e.g.,climate change,population data) and learn about data analysis and visualization.
